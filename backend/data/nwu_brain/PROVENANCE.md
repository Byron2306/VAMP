# NWU Brain Data Provenance and Permissions

This folder contains NWU-specific policy assets (e.g., `policy_playbook.md`, routing
manifests, clause packs, and scoring guidance). These materials may include copyright- or
confidentially-protected institutional text.

## Required actions before external distribution
- Confirm written permission from the content owner for each file in this directory.
- If permission cannot be granted, replace documents with synthesized/redacted versions
  that do not contain proprietary text.
- Document the source, revision, and approval contact for each asset in the table below.

| File | Source / Revision | Approval (name + date) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|
| `policy_playbook.md` | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Review for proprietary policy language. |
| `policy_registry.json` | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Validate distribution rights. |
| `clause_packs.json` | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Ensure clauses are cleared for sharing. |
| `kpa_router.json` | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Verify routing metadata is non-sensitive. |
| Other assets | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Add approvals for any additional files. |

## Internal handling
- Store and process these files only within approved NWU environments.
- Do not transmit the raw text of these files to third-party services without explicit
  approval and a data-sharing agreement.
